# Android-Fyber-Challenge
Android Developer Challenge!
The whole idea of this challenge is to use the Fyber Mobile Offers API (JSON) and
render the results of the response in a native Android application.!
Action Steps!
1. Create a form asking for the variable params (uid, API Key, appid, pub0)!
2. Make the request to the API passing the params and the authentication hash !
3. Get the result from the response.!
4. Check the returned hash to check that it’s a real response (check signature)!
5. Render the offers in a view. !
A. If we have offers there we render them (title, teaser, thumbnail hires and
payout)!
B. If we have no offers there we render a message like ‘No offers’ !
6. Create functional and unit tests (choose your tool)!
7. Check Fyber Mobile Offer API Documentation at http://developer.fyber.com/
content/android/offer-wall/offer-api/!
8. Create a github repository and send us the URL with the solution of the 
!
challenge
